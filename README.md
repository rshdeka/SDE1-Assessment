# SDE1-Assessment
## The objective of this project is to build an asynchronous system that:
### • Receives and validates a CSV file containing product image data.
### • Processes images asynchronously (compressing them to 50% quality).
### • Stores the processed output and product data in a database.
### • Provides immediate feedback with a unique request ID and a status-check API.
### • Optionally triggers a webhook callback upon processing completion.
